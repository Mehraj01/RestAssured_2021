Day 10 :

	More jackson --

	Authentication / Authorization using restAssured

	more jsonPath practice




	----- Providing basic authentication in the request

	--- we put the authentication and Authorization under given section

	  if its a basic auth we would do
	  		given().auth().basic("username","password")
	  	everything else is exactly the same


	 ------ JSON TO JAVA OBJECT
	 	-- store the result of GET /spartan/{id} into POJO object

	 		{
			    "id": 231,
			    "name": "Jenell",
			    "gender": "Male",
			    "phone": 3356824450
			}
			---->> Java Object

		Since our existing Spartan object does not have id field
		so we can not save the id field

		so for easy config , we will just create another Spartan2 POJO
		with id , name , gender , phone fields to start with
		getters and setters
		no arg constructors , 4 arg constructors
		add toString method so we can print it out



-------  Please create a POJP class called Region
-----			 encapsulated fields : region_id , region_name
		  add toString method so we can print out with actual content

		  	Create a new class called HR_ORDS_Test
		  	add @BeforeAll and add baseURI, basePath, port

		  Here is the get request we need to make
		  http://54.174.216.245:1000/ords/hr/regions/1
		  baseURI = http://54.174.216.245
		  port = 1000  // DO NOT HAVE TO REMEMEBER , DEV WILL TELL YOU , OR YOU DONT HAVE IT AT ALL
		  basePath = ords/hr

		  Create a test called testRegion()

		  request :  GET /regions/{region_id}
		  PRINT OUT THE RESULT

------ 	 we will learn how to ignore certain fields from json
		  save the response and we will save the json into Region POJO
		  and we will ignore the extra fields we do not need like links from response

		  YOU CAN USE YOUR OWN IP , BOTH CYBERTEK INSTANCES COMES WITH IT


		  Practice , Create pojo for all Employees , Departments , Locations , Countries , Jobs
		use those 2 endpoints available for each to get all resources save it it as list of pojo , get single resource and save as single POJO ,
		Also try out the open movie DB endpoints
		ignore the fields you do not want to save.
		Here is the link for OMDBAPI  collection : https://www.getpostman.com/collections/74e9200f46f22b1d8cff
		Here is the link for ORDS API  collection : https://www.getpostman.com/collections/39d74311be7e979d3bcd


		try out the Serialization : pojo to json  and json to pojo  for Library App endpoints
		your request will start like this :
		given().header("x-library-token","your long token here" ) (edited)


		Turning POJO to String|Byte[] in our case Json is known as Serialization
		Turning jSON to Java Object (POJO) known as De-serialization
