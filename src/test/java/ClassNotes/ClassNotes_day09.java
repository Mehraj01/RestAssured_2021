Day 04 of RestAssured

	Post Request
		 need body , and need to tell server what kind of data we are sending

     We learned how to pass body using String
     we can also pass body by external file or Map object or custom class object


		in spartan app we should get 201 status code
		and new data should be generated with success

    We want to get the name part random by using java faker dependency

        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.github.javafaker</groupId>
            <artifactId>javafaker</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.2</version>
        </dependency>6


     We can also provide the body as external File
     File f1 = new File("path/to/your/file.json") ;
     given()
     		.contentType(ContentType.json)
     		.body(f1)
	 when()
	 		.post("/spartans")......



	 We can also provide Java objects like Map , or custom type we created(coming later)
	 conversion between Java object and JSON need external handler
	 popular options are :
	 			Jackson library from com.fasterxml.jackson.core
	 			Gson library from google
	 we just need to provide one of these in the classpath (dependency)
	 and restassured will take care of the rest
	 	<dependency>
            <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
            <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
            <version>2.11.2</version>
        </dependency>

       so behind the scene
       its taking the map object and turning it into json when we pass map object to the body
        Map<String, Object> bodyMap = new HashMap<>();
        bodyMap.put("name","Vincent");
        bodyMap.put("gender","Male");
        bodyMap.put("phone",3476346789l);

        given()
                .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
                .body(bodyMap).
        when()
                .post("/spartans").

        jackson-databind is turning the bodyMap object into below json
        {
		    "name": "Vincent",
		    "gender": "Male",
		    "phone": 3476346789
		}

		turning your java object to json (or text files) known as serialization

		you can use it for any request that need such transformation
		like PUT , PATCH




		{
		    "name": "Vincent",
		    "gender": "Male",
		    "phone": 3476346789
		}
		--->> custom java type

		public class Spartan {

			private String name ;
			private String gender ;
			private long phone ;

			// public getters and setters
			// optionally constructors
		}
		// this type of class that has private fields
		// and public getters and setters , optionally constructors
		// also known as pojo (PLAIN OLD JAVA OBJECT)
		// to represent data

		please create a package called pojo
		add class Spartan with 3 encapsulate fields name, gender , phone
		add 2 constructors
				empty no arg constructor
				constructors with 3 arguments to set all the field values

		--------- back to Junit test from here

		continue with your post request in the junit test
		tinstead of providing body
			as string or file or map object ,
		this time we will provide the body as spartan object
		and let jackson to take care of the rest of transformation to json
